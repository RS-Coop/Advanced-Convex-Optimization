[This paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.00746) investigates the formulation of a dual problem for SLAM and uses it for verification. I would propose perhaps implementing the paper or trying to extend it in some way. I would be interested in trying to leverage something about this duality for finding a solution as opposed to just verification."
